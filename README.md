English-language slidedeck and code files for exercise 6 in AL Basics of Programming class.

# Instructions for class

Download all files in this repository and upload them to a CodeBlocks project. Complete the function stubs in `exercise_6.c` and determine which functions `f1` through `f7` run correctly or run incorrectly. 

If you would like to run these files in a Unix environment outside of CodeBlocks, you can run `make exercise_6` in the command line. This will compile and execute your program for you. You will need to ensure that `make` and `gcc` are both installed in your environment. 

Solution file will be uploaded after class, exact time / date TBD.
